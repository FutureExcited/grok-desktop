# Grok Desktop App Demo

### Insane performance

- **Way faster than Electron**
- **Crazy small bundle size**
- User's CPU will thank you

### Current Status

Running on external server with Gemini 2.0 flash (for now) - waiting for Grok3 API access

- Supports streaming responses, written in Rust
- Supports images
- Supports files
- Ready for an easy database integration

### The Dream

With that sweet Grok3 API access:

- Web search
- Deep research
- Thinking
- Image generation

### Platform Support

Linux, Windows - **released**.

**Ready to rock on Mac!** (Just need a MacBook to build it)

## HIRE ME AND LET'S GET THIS DONE!
