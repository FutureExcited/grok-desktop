Always analyze what you've been tasked with first using CoT technique.

For design, you design everything with FULLY (!) rounded corners. Also on hover, the background 
color should change transparency. Each single animation must be fast, smooth and satisfying.

Write it down. And then solve the problem. For commands, use bun.

Finally, for each single component you write, polish the design of it extremely, 
make it look fully production ready, and ONCE AGAIN POLISH IT FULLY.
